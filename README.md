<h3>Who am I?</h3>

---

I am:
- a Master of Business Administration (MBA), an accountant and a tax advisor. (This sound funny a weird, I know, but this field requires the application of a lot of matematics, IT and creativity) üìà
- a C++ (microcontrollers) and JavaScript developer in frontend and backend as well üë®‚Äçüíª
- a certified electrician üîå
- a certified PLC (programmable logic controller) engineer
- the founder of <strong>Project abrIoT</strong>, an open source building automation project aiming to introduce cheap but flexible home automation solutions to every households

<h3>Experiences</h3>

---

I have experience in the following fields:
- Accounting and taxation üòÜ
- Home electricity
- Home automation and smart homes
- Industrial PLCs
- Arduino, JavaScript, HTML and CSS development, databases (time series and relational)
- Microelectronics (PCB) development

<h2>About Porject abrIoT</h2>

<h3>What is abrIoT?</h3>

Project abrIoT is an open source building automation and smarthome project with a strong emphasis on <strong>energy saving</strong>.

---

The aim of the project is to:
- Automate your home ("Smartize")
- Optimize and lower your overall energy consumption (electricity, gas and water)
- Monitor, log and analyize your data
- Expand your home with extra features (e.g. remote controlling, voice recognition, AI)

---

The core of the project is to:
- Implement open source solutions
- Keep installation costs as low as possible
- Comply with EU standards
- Build a community
- Be open to industry standards (e.g. PLC technology, modbus, MQTT)

---

abrIoT is based on the following languages and solutions:
- Linux Debian www.debian.org
- Arduion IDE (C++ for microcontrollers) www.arduino.cc
- JavaScript, Node.js and Node-RED www.nodered.org
- Grafana www.grafana.com
- InfluxDB www.influxdata.com
- abrIoT is based on cheap MCU (microcontoller) and MPU (microporcessor) technology like the famous ESP8266 and EP32.

---

abIoT is also providing simple, cheap tested and CE certified electronics and pre-built distribution boxes which make possible to automate and monitor your home and open it to the net if required.

<h2>How does abrIoT work?</h2>

- Home control is based on abrIoT single-board-PLC-s (SBP) which can be programmed by Arduino or ControlIO (MS Visual Code) by using the abrIoT Arduino libraries (C++)
- Units are communicating via a modbus hierarchy which makes it possible to connect hundreds of devices and thousands of I/O ports
- Extra features like AI, voice recognition, MQTT connection etc. are based on Linux Debian which is run on a single-board-computer (SBC) e.g. RaspberryPi or Olimex A10
- Industrial connectivity is applied (MQTT, modbus) so all "gadgets" are connectable with other industrial grade appliances (e.g. PLC, HMI)

abrIoT Instruction List (IL)  is a simplified version of the IEC61131-3 standard PLC language aimed to home automation. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_list

abrIoT IL works with abrIoT Single-board-PLCs (SBP) or with ESP8266 and ESP32 chipsets.


<h2>Let us look into the future</h2>

The ongoing energy crysis gives us a notable lesson: there is and there will be <strong>no more cheap energy in Europe</strong>. We have to learn how to be more effective. Let us give a chance to save as much energy as possible.
